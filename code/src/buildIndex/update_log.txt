1. support including strand when generating SJs from GTF
2. support converting MPS3junc to HISATjunc
3. support converting HISATjunc to STARjunc
4. support converting BeersGTF to GSNAP gtf (requiring gene_id and transcript_id to generate splice sites.)


Possible bugs:
1.
when do extracting SJ from GTF, transcriptID field is used to identify a transcript,
if exonID or other staff are included, then it is very likely that 
there is no way to identify exons from the same transcript. One way to fix that problem 
is removing other info in that field.
